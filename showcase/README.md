# Context Window Parliament showcase

Replay data comes from the deterministic Python worlds and policies in this repository.

```bash
python showcase/exporter/export_replays.py
python showcase/exporter/export_strategy_summary.py
cd showcase
npm install
npm run dev
```

Run `npm run build` before shipping. The default hearing is `incident-response-medium-004` with the Trained Speaker policy.

## Deploy to Vercel

The repository-root `vercel.json` configures this monorepo automatically. Import the repository in
Vercel and leave the Root Directory set to the repository root. No environment variables are needed
for the current replay-only showcase.

For a CLI deployment:

```bash
npx vercel
npx vercel --prod
```

When the live Modal endpoint is connected later, add its public URL as a Vercel environment variable
and keep `HUD_API_KEY` and `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY` only in Modal secrets.
